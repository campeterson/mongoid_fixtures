## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mongoid_fixtures'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mongoid_fixtures

## Example Usage

1.  Define some Mongoid Documents. The class structure is pretty silly and only meant to demonstrate the different modes. 

        class GeopoliticalDivision
          include Mongoid::Document
          field :name, type: String
          field :time_zone, type: String
          field :demonym, type: String
          field :settled, type: Integer
          field :consolidated, type: Integer
          field :custom_attributes, type: Array
          belongs_to :geo_uri_scheme
          embeds_one :population
          embeds_many :people

        end

        class Population
          include Mongoid::Document

          field :total, type: Integer
          field :rank, type: Integer
          field :density, type: String
          field :msa, type: Integer
          field :csa, type: Integer
          field :source, type: String
          embedded_in :geopolitical_division

        end

        class City < GeopoliticalDivision
          include Mongoid::Document
          belongs_to :state
        end

        class State < GeopoliticalDivision
          include Mongoid::Document

          field :motto, type: String
          field :admission_to_union, type: String

          has_many :cities

        end

        class GeoUriScheme
          include Mongoid::Document

          field :x, type: Float
          field :y, type: Float
          field :z, type: Float

          alias :longitude :x
          alias :latitude :y
          alias :altitude :z
        end

        class Person
          include Mongoid::Document

          embedded_in :geopolitical_division

          field :first_name, type: String
          field :paternal_surname, type: String
          field :born, type: Date
          field :description, type: String
          field :middle_name, type: String
          field :suffix, type: String
          field :died, type: Date
          field :maternal_surname, type: String
          field :nick_names, type: Array

        end

2.  Defin efixtures  in /test/fixtures/ with a plural form of the class

    /test/fixtures/cities.yml:

    You may notice attributes that represent relationships are automatically converted to
    the corresponding ruby objects based on the provided id. Currently, this library supports
    1-N referenced, 1-1 referenced, 1-1 embedded relationships, and 1-N embedded relationships.
    If a relation already exists in the db, this library will return it instead of recreating it.
    
3.  Invoke `MongoidFixtures::load(City)`
4.  The above method invocation will load all test fixture instances of City objects defined
    in /test/fixtures/cities.yml as well as dependent objects
5.  Use your fixtures!

        cities = MongoidFixtures::load(City)
        puts cities # {:new_york_city=>#<City _id: 55ebc6b2e138231068000004, name: "New York City", time_zone: nil, demonym: "New Yorker", settled: 1624, consolidated: 1989, custom_attributes: [{"boroughs"=>["Manhattan", "The Bronx", "Brooklyn", "Queens", "Staten Island"]}], geo_uri_scheme_id: BSON::ObjectId('55ebc6b2e138231068000006'), _type: "City", state_id: BSON::ObjectId('55ebc6b2e138231068000000')>, :terrytown=>#<City _id: 55ebc6b2e13823106800000c, name: "Terrytown", time_zone: nil, demonym: nil, settled: nil, consolidated: nil, custom_attributes: nil, geo_uri_scheme_id: BSON::ObjectId('55ebc6b2e138231068000005'), _type: "City", state_id: BSON::ObjectId('55ebc6b2e138231068000002')>}

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
